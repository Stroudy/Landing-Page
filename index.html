    <h3>Animated comedy short film</h3>

            Big Buck Bunny (code-named Project Peach) is a 2008 animated comedy
            short film featuring animals of the forest, made by the Blender
            Institute, part of the Blender Foundation. Like the foundation's
            previous film, Elephants Dream, the film was made using Blender, a
            free and open-source software application for 3D computer modeling
            and animation developed by the same foundation. Unlike that earlier
            project, the tone and visuals departed from a cryptic story and dark
            visuals to one of comedy, cartoons, and light-heartedness.

        <p>
          The plot follows a day in the life of Big Buck Bunny, during which
          time he meets three bullying rodents: the leader, Frank the flying
          squirrel, and his sidekicks Rinky the red squirrel and Gimera the
          chinchilla. The rodents amuse themselves by harassing helpless
          creatures of the forest by throwing fruits, nuts, and rocks at them.
          After the rodents kill two butterflies with an apple and a rock, and
          then attack Bunny, he sets aside his gentle nature and orchestrates a
          complex plan to avenge the two butterflies. Using a variety of traps,
          Bunny first dispatches Rinky and Gimera. Frank, unaware of the fate of
          the other two, is seen taking off from a tree, and gliding towards a
          seemingly unsuspecting Bunny. Once airborne, Frank triggers Bunny's
          final series of traps, causing Frank to crash into a tree branch and
          plummet into a spike trap below. At the last moment, Frank grabs onto
          what he believes is the branch of a small tree, but discovers it is
          just a twig Bunny is holding over the spikes. Bunny snatches up Frank.
          The film concludes with Bunny being pleased with himself as a
          butterfly flies past him holding a string, at the end of which is
          Frank attached as a flying kite.

          <p>
            Following Elephants Dream (2006), Big Buck Bunny is the first
            project by the Blender Foundation to be created by the Blender
            Institute, a division of the foundation set up specifically to
            facilitate the creation of open content films and games. Work began
            in October 2007.[citation needed] The film was funded by the Blender
            Foundation, donations from the Blender community, pre-sales of the
            film's DVD and commercial sponsorship. Both the final product and
            production data, including animation data, characters and textures
            are released under the Creative Commons Attribution License. It was
            rendered on Sun Microsystems' grid computing facility Sun Grid. As
            in Elephants Dream, Blender developers worked extensively to improve
            the software in accordance with the needs of the movie team.
            Improvements were made in hair and fur rendering, the particle
            system, UV mapping, shading, the render pipeline, constraints, and
            skinning. Also introduced during the project was approximate ambient
            occlusion. These features were released to the public with Blender.

        <h2 class="section-title" id="release">Release</h2>
        <p>
          The film was officially released in an April 10, 2008 premiere in
          Amsterdam while online movie downloads and files were released on May
          30, 2008. High-resolution, stereoscopic, high-frame-rate versions of
          the film were released in 2013 by Janus Kristensen's Big and Ugly
          Rendering Project running on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
          Network Computing platform. The film was followed up with an open game
          titled Yo Frankie!, in August 2008.

          <p>
            The main character (called Big Buck Bunny) was also used in short
            films created by Renderfarm.fi: What is Renderfarm.fi? (2011)
            telling about the advantages of render farms and BBB loves CC (2012)
            promoting Creative Commons licences. The bunny's voice was performed
            by Jan Morgenstern, who was the composer of a Big Buck Bunny movie
            soundtrack.[17] Frank the flying squirrel is also the player
            character in the Blender Institute's 2009 video game Yo Frankie!.
